# flighter 
## v0.5

flighter (better name pending) is a simple-enough chrome extension that
looks in the body of facebook posts and highlights them based on certain
criteria. Currently the only criterion available is a find function.

However, there's still a lot you can do with this. For example, if there's
a certain news topic you don't want to miss, match some relevant terms with
an easily visible colour and they'll stand out in your feed.

People are excellent at adapting to and using visual cues, and using flighter
you can set up visual cues as suits your needs!


Using this repo:
To install flighter just download, unpack to a good 
location and load it in chrome as an unpacked extension.
